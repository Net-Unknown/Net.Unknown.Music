      <h3>Artist, Producer, Sound Engineer</h3>
        <p>New Orleans native and Future Loyola Grad, Isaiah Carter is an electronic music artist and sound engineer in training. <br> 9th grade, Isaiah's love for music was realized as he spent every afternoon he could in the band room of Benjamin Franklin High School teaching himself how to play the drums. However, it wasn't until 11th grade that he would start to dabble in music production after a friend gave him a copy of Ableton Live 10 Lite. This gift, a product of their jam session, was the moment Isaiah realized that he could start doing music production himself. <br>Now Isaiah spends most of his time: working live sound gigs, playing drums, helping run sound for his church, and making music. His inspirations are Haywyre, Virtual Riot, PJ Morton, Andy Mineo, and many more. <br>He has not released music yet but he hopes to be able to release his first official single soon under the name Net.Unknown. <br>Join him on his journey towards fulfillment.</p>
